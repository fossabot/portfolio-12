<p>I started with this plugin for this portfolio (which is build using <a class="text-link" href="https://jekyllrb.com/" rel="noopener">Jekyll</a>) so that I wouldn't have to manually download my webfont from <a class="text-link" href="http://fontello.com/" el="noopener">Fontello</a> each time I needed a new icon. During the development of this site I modified and tweaked the script, and finally I decided to release it as <a class="text-link" href="https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-fontello" rel="noopener">a Gem</a>. I also added it to the list of plugins on the Jekyll website (<a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/6757" rel="noopener">#6757</a>) and the Fontello README.md (<a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/fontello/fontello/pull/635" rel="noopener">#635</a>).</p>
