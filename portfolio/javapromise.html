<p>I was inspired to do this project by the JavaScript <a class="text-link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise" rel="noopener">Promise</a> concept. JavaPromise is an limited implementation in Java of promises. It allows developers to create short threads which run a callable upon completion based on the success of the calculation (through <code class="code-inline">then</code> and <code class="code-inline">except</code>).</p>
