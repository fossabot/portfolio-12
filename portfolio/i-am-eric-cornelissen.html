<p>I was inspired to create a onepager to introduce myself by the website <a class="text-link" href="https://onepagelove.com/" rel="noopener">One Page Love</a>. I wanted to create a relatively short page that encouraged visitors to scroll through to the end and have seen my key character traits. The main interaction on the site is by hovering over elements, with only a single clickable element per section.</p>
