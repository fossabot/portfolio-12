<p>This GitHub bot was started because of an issue created by a contributor of the Simple Icons project (<a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/issues/743" rel="noopener">#743</a>). The bot converts any SVG icon commited to the <code class="code-inline">develop</code> branch of the Simple Icons repository and converts it into a PDF version of the icon. Currently, the bot is being tested and it commits the PDF files to a separate repository (<a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons-pdf" rel="noopener">simple-icons-pdf</a>) so the behavior of the bot and the PDF files can be evaluated in isolation.</p>
