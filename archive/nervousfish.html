<p>I did this project at <a class="text-link" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/" rel="noopener">TU Delft</a>. We created an Android application which can be used to exchange public keys over Bluetooth, NFC or via QR codes to replace or ease <a class="text-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party" rel="noopener">Key Signing Parties</a>. We focused on preventing Man in the Middle attacks when Bluetooth is used so users are sure they received the correct key.</p>
