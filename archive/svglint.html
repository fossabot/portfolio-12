<p>As this linter was relatively new, there was a small issue with the command line utilities when using it on Windows. Because it was originally develop on a Unix system, the input paths where automatically globbed, which does not happen on Windows. So in <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/birjolaxew/svglint/pull/3">#3</a> I added support for globbing on Windows using an existing package and some clever mapping of the input.</p>
