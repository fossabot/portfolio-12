<p>I started contributing to the Simple Icons project by submitting a Pull Request for the CSS3 icon (<a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/pull/373" rel="noopener">#373</a>), since then I added multiple different icons. Besides that I implemented a relative luminance filter in Jekyll to darken icons on lighter backgrounds (<a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/pull/488" rel="noopener">#488</a>), added fuzzy search (<a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/pull/659" rel="noopener">#659</a>) and improved the docs on multiple occasions. Over time I became more invested into the project and became one of the maintainers as well.</p>
