<p>Pinned tabs started as a simple implementation of pinned tabs as seen in modern browsers for the Atom text editor. It was originally written in CoffeeScript and Less, and was later rewritten with ES6 JavaScript using <a class="text-link" href="https://babeljs.io/" rel="noopener">Babel</a>.</p>

<p>Later version added support for modified tabs, animations, fixed pinned tab locations, Visual Studio style pinning, and reliable pinning across different panes.</p>
