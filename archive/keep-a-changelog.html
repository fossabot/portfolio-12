title: Keep a Changelog

<p>After I found out about this site through the <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator" rel="noopener">github-changelog-generator</a>, I wanted to see if I could contribute because it convinced me of the importance of changelogs. So I did a review of a PR for a Dutch translation of the Keep a Changelog project (<a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/pull/211" rel="noopener">#211</a>).</p>
