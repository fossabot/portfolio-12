<p>Once I started using <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/htmllint/htmllint" rel="noopener">htmllint</a> and found out there existed no Atom linter plugin, I decided to start one myself. I started with a fork of <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-htmlhint" rel="noopener">linter-htmlhint</a> and modified the code such that it worked for htmllint instead of htmlhint. On top of that I added a feature to report new bugs directly from the Atom editor, and the option to automatically disable the linter if no configuration file is found.</p>
