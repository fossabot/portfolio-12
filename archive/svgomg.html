<p>SVGOMG is a tool that I frequently use and got to know thourgh the <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons">Simple Icon</a> project. I myself and the Simple Icons community were facing an issue regarding the settings of the tool, and wanted a way to reset them. Hence, I went ahead an proposed a reset button in Pull Request <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/jakearchibald/svgomg/pull/141">#141</a>, which lead to Pull Request <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/jakearchibald/svgomg/pull/142">#142</a> in which I collaborated with <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/jakearchibald">Jake Archibald</a> (the maintainer of SVGOMG) to get a working reset button for the settings on the website.</p>

<p>You can now use the button on the <a class="text-link" href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/">site</a>! It is at the bottom of the settings panel.</p>
