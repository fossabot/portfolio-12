  <p>As an early user of this terminal emulator for Windows 10, I decided I wanted to help develop it. Unfamiliar with the Universal Windows Platform and not fluent in C# I decided to start with a fairly simple requested feature: an about dialogue. In collaboration with the owner of the project I implemented this in Pull Request <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/felixse/FluentTerminal/pull/103" rel="noopener">#103</a>.</p>
